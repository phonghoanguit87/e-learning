        Online learning is an effective way to update skills in a specific field. It also allows employees to quickly
        develop new skills. Employees can learn at the workplace or at home without having to travel. This is especially
        useful in times of crisis like the current one [1].

    <p>
        Description: eLearning has proven to be the best tool in the corporate sector, especially as multinational
        corporations run training programs for professionals across the world, where employees can acquire important
        skills while sitting in a board room or conducting a seminar. Under one roof for employees of the same or
        different organisations. Schools that use e-learning technologies are a step ahead of those that are still using
        traditional learning methods [2].

    <p>Chances are anyone who has used e-learning will tell you how powerful and convenient it is. In today's always-on
        world, e-learning offers many benefits to learners and organizations. But what exactly is e-learning? Whether
        you're an online learning expert or a beginner, there's no denying that its popularity has skyrocketed over the
        past decade. For employers, it provides an economical and time-saving way to train employees. In return,
        employees benefit from convenient training to improve their skills and knowledge. Organizations also use it to
        educate their partners and customers to increase adoption, retention and ultimately sales. The demand for
        e-learning solutions does not appear to be waning, with the market expected to reach $275 billion by 2022. Let’s
        take a closer look at what e-learning is, the different e-learning types and tools, and the benefits it can
        bring to your organization[3].
    </p>

    <h6>E learning can help you meet your learning goals.</h6>
    <p>
        I’d like to know if you have other goals for e-learning, and/or what your preference(s) would be, in terms of
        priority, and how successful e-learning has been so far in meeting your preferred goals. So please post a
        comment, and identify what kind of stakeholder you are[4].
    </p>
    <p>
        Setting effective eLearning goals is important in implementing eLearning as it will help in producing great
        results if one knows how to use it. The key success of effective eLearning is not only to set goals but to
        set the right goals. Therefore, it is significant to understand the types of different goals and its unique
        differences because each goal has its own objectives[5].
    </p>
    <p>
        Having said that, too often individuals or institutions have launched into e-learning without a clear
        understanding of what they are hoping to achieve. Therefore a first step for any instructor – or institution
        considering investment in e-learning – should be to define their expectations and goals, even accepting that
        these may legitimately change as more experience and knowledge is gained about the potential and limitations of
        using technology for teaching and learning[4].
    </p>

    <h5><span class="text-info">E learning can be used in a variety of contexts.</span></h5>
    <p>
        In its formative years, e-learning tools primarily enabled the delivery of learning material directly from
        teacher to learner. Now, the e-learning experience has evolved to enable more multi-directional communication
        using increasingly interactive tools. Students, employees and independent learners alike have greater freedom in
        choosing how they receive and respond to e-learning content, and any number of peers can be involved[6].
    </p>
    <p>
        Definition: A learning system based on formalised teaching but with the help of electronic resources is known as
        E-learning. While teaching can be based in or out of the classrooms, the use of computers and the Internet forms
        the major component of E-learning. E-learning can also be termed as a network enabled transfer of skills and
        knowledge, and the delivery of education is made to a large number of recipients at the same or different times.
        Earlier, it was not accepted wholeheartedly as it was assumed that this system lacked the human element required
        in learning[2].
    </p>
    <p>
        So below I have collected together some of the more common rationales or expectations for e-learning that I have
        encountered, both in the literature and in discussion with different stakeholder groups. I will then examine
        each of
        these separately, trying in particular to show how success or failure in achieving these goals could be
        measured[4].
